                        <b class="p-start">A</b>rtificial intelligence has become a popular buzzword in popular culture
                        in the past few years. Unfortunately,both mainstream and science-fiction media tend to choose
                        dramatization over scientific fact, and have been a big factor in spreading misinformation about
                        the capabilities of AI. Because of misinformation in movies, television, books, and other media,
                        some people believe that AI is so powerful, it will take over the world. All they can see is
                        that we have the possibility of a future run by AI, particularly with the improvements in
                        computing equipment performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Quantum computing has been a shining goal of computing for years, and a number of companies have
                        introduced prototypes that, while not being widely adopted as of yet, show the major advances in
                        speed and power that quantum computing can bring. Quantum computing is still in its infancy, but
                        it has tremendous possibilities for its future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So will AIs, backed up by the power of quantum computing, grow so strong that they will one day
                        dominate the world? The truth is that when they are combined, AI and quantum computing can
                        provide great possibilities in a number of different industries and applied uses. These two
                        fields of computer science are very powerful and can both stand on their own. However, even
                        greater possibilities arise when they are combined. Whether this combination can run the world
                        has yet to be seen. Nonetheless, don’t look for AI and/or quantum computers to become the next
                        Big Brother. Below, I'll discuss the capabilities of these two revolutionary fields right now,
                        and discuss the possibilities for the future of quantum computing and AI combined together.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What AI can and cannot do</h4>
                    <p>
                        Although popular media has portrayed artificial intelligence as a powerful tool that dominates
                        the future, there are limits to its capabilities. Neural networks are meant to simulate human
                        brain activity, where each node is a neuron. However, artificial intelligence has not reached
                        the point where it can continuously learn and adapt, nor use common sense (1). The artificial
                        intelligence that we know today comes from taking a dataset with predetermined inputs and then
                        training the model to determine the best possible output or behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most artificial intelligence used in organizations and companies today is very specific. It can
                        tell you who's most likely to order a product based on the item and their profile, what TV shows
                        and movies you probably want to watch (Netflix does this), interpret and give results for things
                        you ask for (voice assistants like Alexa and Siri), and many other things! This application of
                        artificial intelligence won’t work for any problem, as it's only programmed to work for a
                        specific topic and criteria.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The other type of AI that is much harder to develop, meaning it cannot be used, because so far,
                        it hasn't been realized, is a general (or bottom-up) AI. The reason why this type of AI is so
                        difficult is because of the constraints of a machine that humans don’t have. A famous scientist
                        named Gödel came up with a formula saying that if we have a formal arithmetic system F, it is
                        impossible to construct a computer which will output all theorems of F. He showed this by giving
                        the example of the Gödel Sentence G which is in F, that states “I am not a theorem of F.” If
                        this theorem is true, then it leads to a contradiction in F. However, if it is not true, then F
                        is incomplete, because it cannot be proved. (4)
                    </p>
                    <img id="godel" src="./Godel-Theorem.jpg" alt="Gödel's Theorem">
                    <p>
                        This example proved that machines have constraints that humans don’t. Gödel was able to see the
                        flaw with the arithmetic system F, and humans can account for this, while no machine could
                        account for this, because it itself exists within these constraints.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This isn’t to say that general AI cannot be achieved. In fact, another scientist named
                        Schmidhuber developed the Gödel machine, which uses a recursive strategy to self-improve (4).
                        Still, we have not been able to develop an AI system that is capable of self-developing, other
                        than very specific situations. Branislav Holländer, who wrote an article on this topic, stated
                        this:
                    </p>
                    <p class="quote">
                        The problem with [an AI that develops without human intervention], however, is that we actually
                        did not succeed in constructing any self-improving AI. Today’s machine learning algorithms are
                        capable of modifying themselves to a certain degree, e.g. one-shot learning algorithms, but it
                        is not nearly at the level of human development. Genetic algorithms may be able to self-improve
                        by mechanisms similar to biological life, but they usually require a fair amount of fine-tuning
                        by humans to work correctly. A self-improving AI on the other hand, would only require the
                        intelligence of a newborn at first and could develop itself from that point on to any level of
                        intelligence required.

                            May Never Develop General AI</a></h4>
                    <p>
                        However, this does not mean that AI cannot do fantastic things. In 2020, DeepMind’s AI solved
                        the protein-folding problem, which had been baffling Scientists for 50 years (2). Other examples
                        include virtual assistants, which many people had thought were impossible, but now exist in most
                        smartphones, and automated vehicles, which for the drive better than most humans in general
                        situations. AI still continues to develop, and it continues to have technological breakthroughs!
                    </p>
                    <h4>What is Quantum Computing</h4>
                    <p>
                        The idea of quantum computing was first proposed by Richard Feynman in 1982. He wanted to apply
                        quantum mechanics to the growing field of computing. His ideas were put into a research paper
                        that introduced the idea of a quantum turing machine. After that, more scientists began to come
                        up with quantum solutions to problems in computing. Solutions to well-known computer science
                        problems went from being exponential in time to only taking polynomial time. The major reason
                        for this is because of quantum parallelism (3). Qubits are quantum bits, meaning at any point in
                        time, they can be a zero, one, or a superposition of both zero and one. This superposition has a
                        drastic effect on the amount of processing, because it means that when we are processing bits,
                        we can process all the bits at the same time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because of this, when we put quantum bits into a quantum register (a register that holds quantum
                        bits) with a capacity of n bits, we can calculate all possible values of an algorithm with
                        length n with astounding time differences. The possibilities are endless!

                    <h4>Quantum Applications in Artificial Intelligence</h4>
                    <p>
                        From reading above, you should be able to see why these concepts are both so powerful on their
                        own. So what happens when the two are combined? Well, right now the possibilities are mostly
                        conjecture, because this field hasn’t really been explored yet. However, big companies recognize
                        its potential, and Google even unveiled a new campus earlier this year dedicated to Quantum AI.
                        (5)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the areas where quantum AI would be most useful is with searching. Many AI applications
                        have to search for data. In fact, the field of information retrieval is solely based on
                        retrieving information from sources and then presenting the most relevant information. However,
                        gathering the resources is no small task. It can take minutes, hours, or even days! Because of
                        this, quantum search has been a popular topic. There is already an algorithm made for this too,
                        called Grover’s algorithm (3).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In classical computing, if you were searching for an item in a list, you would have to check
                        about n/2 items for most lists using binary search, which is an O(log n) with n iterations for
                        the algorithm. However, using the properties of superposition and phase interference, it would
                        take only about half the amount of iterations, making the quantum version only have n the amount
                        of iterations as the classical version! (6) This can make a huge difference when you combine it
                        with AI. Say you want to search every single consumer site on the internet to find the best
                        trend in prices for items on websites like amazon. First you’d need to pull in the data, but
                        with all that data in an index (structure that holds data), you’d need to search through it to
                        find the best possible trends. A classical algorithm would take too long to run for this to be a
                        viable option. However, quantum algorithms could make this possible! That data would have a lot
                        of fascinating implications on market research as well. This is just speculation though, as
                        there has yet to be any publicly known successful implementations of Grover’s algorithm.

                    <p>
                        Another subset of Artificial Intelligence is called deep learning, which is a revolutionary
                        field that requires far less human intervention, is more powerful, and much more complex than
                        traditional machine learning. One of the most popular concepts in deep learning is neural
                        networks. Neural networks are a popular structure in deep learning that was named for its
                        similarity to the brain. In neural networks, each node is a neuron, and inputs go through
                        several layers of neurons to reach an output.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So where does quantum computing come in? Well, neural networks are notoriously difficult because
                        of all the layers each neuron has to go through before reaching the output layer. Adding more
                        neurons to the neural network scales it exponentially, because of all the extra layers that each
                        neuron added has to go through. However, researchers have already come up with possible methods
                        to make quantum neural networks. The most significant advantage to this is that the intermediate
                        states in each layer are greatly reduced, with qubits scaling with the network width instead of
                        exponentially increasing (7). So where does quantum computing come in? Well, neural networks are

                    <p>
                        Quantum computing is still in its early stages, with much more research needing to be done to
                        get sustainable quantum systems. Quantum systems right now need to be kept frigid in order to
                        retain quantum properties such as qubits. This makes algorithms mostly impossible to test,
                        because of the very limited availability of any quantum systems. Still, Artificial intelligence
                        and quantum computing are emerging rapidly in technology today, and together they can
                        potentially even provide solutions to some of our longest known problems, like energy
                        sustainability or incurable diseases like cancer. While many of the applications are still
                        unrealized because of the aforementioned constraints, with both fields growing, the
                        possibilities will increase exponentially!
