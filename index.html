                       <b class="p-start">A</b>rtificial intelligence has become a popular buzzword in popular culture in the past few years. Unfortunately,both mainstream and science-fiction media tend to choose dramatization over scientific fact, and have been a big factor in spreading misinformation about the capabilities of AI. Because of misinformation in movies, television, books, and other media, some people believe that AI is so powerful, it will take over the world. All they can see is that we have the possibility of a future run by AI, particularly with the improvements in computing equipment performance.

                        Quantum computing has been a shining goal of computing for years, and a number of companies have introduced prototypes that, while not being widely adopted as of yet, show the major advances in speed and power that quantum computing can bring. Quantum computing is still in its infancy, but it has tremendous possibilities for its future.

                    <p>
                        So will AIs, backed up by the power of quantum computing, grow so strong that they will one day dominate the world? The truth is that when they are combined, AI and quantum computing can provide great possibilities in a number of different industries and applied uses. These two fields of computer science are very powerful and can both stand on their own. However, even greater possibilities arise when they are combined. Whether this combination can run the world has yet to be seen. Nonetheless, donâ€™t look for AI and/or quantum computers to become the next Big Brother. Below, I'll discuss the capabilities of these two revolutionary fields right now, and discuss the possibilities for the future of quantum computing and AI combined together.
